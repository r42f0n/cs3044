DMS 213 LEC: Immigration and   Film
Fall   2024
Course   Description
This class explores representations of immigration   in global   film with   particular   attention   to different modes of knowing engendered by the   immigrant   experience.   Topics   for   discussion   include global flows, border crossing, place and displacement,   migration,   mobility,   and   diaspora.   Please be aware that some of these topics and the   films   we   watch   are   controversial   and   may contain intellectually and emotionally challenging   material.

Note on Assignment Submissions, Grading, and Course Communication
As   I already mentioned, I do   not accept   late   assignments,   nor   do   I   accept   submissions via      email. All assignments must be submitted on time to   UBlearns.   Please   do   not attempt to submit   late assignments by emailing them if   you miss the   UBlearns deadline.   I will   not grade these   assignments.   In particular, do not attempt to submit   multiple   assignments   at the   end   of   the   semester.
While excuses such as “I forgot about the deadline,”   etc.   are   not   acceptable,   I   understand that   there are   legitimate emergencies.   In these   rare instances, such as   a   medical   or family   emergency, please contact the professor.   Do not contact the professor to discuss missed work   unless you have a legitimate emergency.
Additionally, all your submissions must follow   UB’s academic   integrity   policy.   In short,   do   not plagiarize or use AI to generate content.   Do your own work, write your   own   responses.   Any   submissions that violate this policy will receive a zero   without the   possibility of   revision.   Also, grades are final.   Please do not solicit the   professor, TAs, or   graders   to   regrade   your   assignment, to “boost” your grade, or help your gpa. All   solicitations   of this   kind,   particularly   at   the end of the semester, are   inappropriate.
More generally,   it   is   inappropriate to repeatedly email or send   multiple emails to the   professor and/or TAs and graders to request changes to your   grade.   If   you   need   to   discuss   your work with the professor or a TA,   it   is best to   do   so   in   person   after   class   or   in   office   hours.   Most discussions   regarding your work in class are too complex for   email.   If you   do   send   an email   regarding something that   requires a brief   response, please   provide the   context, which includes information such as your   name, the class,   and the   assignment.
Finally, if you are experiencing difficult circumstances or   have   failed   to   submit   assignments,   I encourage you to be self-evaluative and consider   if you   can   meet   the   requirements of the course   during the current semester.   If not,   consider   taking   the   course when it is offered at   a time when you   are   better   able   to   fulfill   the   requirements.
